# Metagenomics of Cheese Rind Microbiomes :cheese: :dna:

This repository contains code, raw data, and results files used for analyzing metagenomes from five distinct washed rind cheese microbiomes. This repository is associated with the figures produced for the [Metagenomics of Cheese Rind Microbiomes pub](insert doi once it is available). Raw reads and assemblies can be found in the [European Nucleotide Archive under Project PRJEB58160](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/view/PRJEB58160). This includes a total of 24 metagenomic assemblies from five distinct washed rind cheese microbiomes. For three cheeses, paired short and long read sequencing data from three different timepoints in the cheese aging process is available.

The "viral_prediction_summary_tables" folder within 'processed_data' contains summaries of the combined viral prediction tables from [GeNomad 1.2.0 with database v1.1](https://zenodo.org/record/7015982#.Y9hoMi2B28c) and [CheckV 1.0.1 with database v1.4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-00774-7) for nine of the long read metagenomic assemblies.

The "cheesegenomes-k31-scaled1k" within 'databases' contains sourmash signatures from previously sequenced microbial genomes from cheese. These signatures were used in the 'sourmash gather' analysis.
